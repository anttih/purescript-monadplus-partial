### Partial maps and filters over MonadPlus instances for PureScript

This is a PureScript port of the Haskell package
[monadplus](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monadplus) by Hans Hoglund. That
package in turn was inspired by [a blog post by Conal
Elliott](http://conal.net/blog/posts/a-handy-generalized-filter).
